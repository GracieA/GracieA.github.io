		<h1> Book Series </h1>

		<p> Books series are very enjoyable. Many series are three books, trilogies, and some series have as many as 13 books, each telling the next section of the story. I like reading series becuase it doesn't end at just one book, and the story can be longer, with more opportunity for character growth and new developments.  </p>
