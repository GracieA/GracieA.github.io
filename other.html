		<p> here are some of the books that I like that do not fit into the two previous categories. Firstly, we have Silence of the Lambs, which I read recently. Its different from the books that I usually read, but I really like it. Then, we have an author, Tamara Ireland Stone. In her category, I listed my three favorite books that she has written. </p>
		
		<h3>Silence of the Lambs</h3>

		<p> A note: I have both read the book and seen the movie, and I personally like the book more than the movie. </p>
