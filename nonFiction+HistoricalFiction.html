		<p> Although I don't read many non- fiction books, I usually like the ones that I do read. I included historical fiction books in this category, because they are based in non- fiction historical events. </p>

		<p> The first book, Salt to the Sea, follows four young people in East Prussia during World War 2. The four characters are Joana, a nurse from Lithuania, Emilia, a teenager and an orphan, Florian, a restoration artist, and Alfred, a nazi. They all meet when they travel to get onto the Wilhelm Gustloff, a ship headed for Germany. The second book, Fountains of Silence, is set in Madrid in 1957, Spain currently being under the rule of Francisco Franco. The perspective alternates between Daneil, a Texan photographer, Ana, a worker at the hotel Daniel is staying at, Rafa, Ana's brother who is a gravedigger, and Puri, Ana and Rafa's cousin and also a nun. We follow Daniel's intrepid photography adventures and learn more about the characters' backstories. The last book, Between shades of Gray, follows the story of Lena and her family. Lena is from Lithuania, and is the cousin of Joana, a character from Salt to the Sea. </p>
		<p>a note: I have not read all of Ruta Sepetys' books, so I just put the books that I have read.</p>
