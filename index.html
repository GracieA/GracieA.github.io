			<p> This website is to tell you (the reader) about books that I have read and that I like. I hope you enjoy! </p>

		<h2>about the author</h2>	
			<p>here is a little bit about me. My name is Gracie, and I am currently in eighth grade. My birthday is May 8th, and I am a Taurus. I like books (as you've probably guessed), and I usually prefer books to movies. There are some exceptions, like when a movie comes before the book.</p>
